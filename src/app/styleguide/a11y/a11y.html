    <h1 class="c-item-container__heading">Accessibility</h1>
    <p class="c-item-container__desc">The whole theme was developed with accessibility in mind and that's why each component has a visual focus indicator for navigating throughout the page using a Tab button. For aesthetic & usability reasons it is recommended to only enable focus indicator once the Tab key was pressed. In fact, this provides the same UX as with default browser styling.</p>
    <p class="c-item-container__desc">Theme doesn't provide such functionality to keep it simple and not include JavaScript in its package. If you are developer, you can toggle <code>u-no-outline</code> utility class for <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> on <code>keydown</code> event.</p>
